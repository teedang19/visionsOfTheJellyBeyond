Quickstart:

You must have mongo installed.

    npm install mongodb
    

Then you can:

    git clone https://github.com/teedang19/visionsOfTheJellyBeyond.git


From root directory, set up mongoDB.

  
    mkdir data
    cd data
    mongod --dbpath <current_FULL_file_path; ex: /Users/Tam/Desktop/bakeries/data >
    
Now you have a mongod connection open.  Keep it open! In a new terminal tab:

    npm install
    npm start

Navigate to `localhost:3000` and you should be running.
